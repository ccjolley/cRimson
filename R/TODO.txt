* Not clear how to export a single function from suggest_edge_series.R
* make header for ws_to_dtm.R
* make header for community_topics.R
* make header for cluster_dtm.R
* add @author line to all headers

* It might be nice to have a version of sma_bar designed specifically for communities, with the same color-coding, that shows something like the mayor of the community or the most common terms.
